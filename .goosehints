# AI Skills Library — Goose Hints

## What This Repository Is

This is the **universal AI skills library** — 97 production-ready skill packages across 13 professional domains with 178 Python automation tools and 12 CI/CD workflows. It works with every major AI coding assistant.

**This is NOT a traditional application.** It's a library of self-contained skill packages meant to be extracted and deployed into user workflows.

## Repository Structure

- `engineering-team/` — 24 core engineering skills + 50 Python tools
- `engineering/` — 12 advanced architecture skills + 33 Python tools
- `marketing-skill/` — 10 marketing skills + 6 Python tools
- `product-team/` — 7 product skills + 6 Python tools
- `project-management/` — 9 PM skills + 5 Python tools
- `c-level-advisor/` — 5 C-level advisory skills + 4 Python tools
- `ra-qm-team/` — 12 regulatory/quality skills + 10 Python tools
- `business-growth/` — 3 business skills + 9 Python tools
- `data-analytics/` — 5 data analytics skills
- `hr-operations/` — 4 HR operations skills
- `sales-success/` — 5 sales success skills
- `finance/` — 1 finance skill + 4 Python tools
- `scripts/` — Skill installer + utility scripts

## Skill Package Pattern

Every skill follows this structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md       # Master documentation with workflows
├── scripts/       # Python CLI tools (standard library only, no ML/LLM calls)
├── references/    # Expert knowledge bases
└── assets/        # User-facing templates
```

## Tool Execution

Use the skill installer to browse and install skills:

```bash
# Browse available skills
python scripts/skill-installer.py list
python scripts/skill-installer.py list --group engineering-team

# Install a skill
python scripts/skill-installer.py install senior-fullstack --agent goose
python scripts/skill-installer.py install content-creator --agent goose

# Update installed skills
python scripts/skill-installer.py update
```

## Key Principles

1. Skills are products — each skill is deployable as a standalone package
2. Documentation-driven — clear, actionable docs over generic advice
3. Algorithm over AI — deterministic analysis (Python scripts) over LLM calls
4. Template-heavy — ready-to-use templates users customize
5. Self-contained — no dependencies between skills

## Anti-Patterns

- Creating dependencies between skills
- Adding complex build systems or test frameworks
- Generic advice instead of specific, actionable frameworks
- LLM/ML calls in scripts (defeats portability)
